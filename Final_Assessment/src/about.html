        My name is Hephzibah Nick-Oshomah, I am 20 years old and I hail from
        Nigeria. My hobbies include reading and drawing, the latter I would say
        is my talent.

        The reason why I chose Scrabble is because It holds a special place in
        my heart as it was one of the first board games I learned as a child. My
        father studied literature in university, so he made sure I and my
        sisters were especially learned when it came to english. Scrabble was
        one of the tools he introduced to us to help us gain a wider vocabulary
        not to mention he absolutely loved playing it with us but when he
        couldn't, we settled for playing it on the family computer.
      </p>

        Needless to say, my father's plan worked and even got me interested in
        reading literature. I would fully recommend this game to anyone, young
        or old because you never stop learning and it is so much fun
