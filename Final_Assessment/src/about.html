        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>My name is Hephzibah Nick-Oshomah. I am 20 years old and I hail from Nigeria
            My hobbies include reading and drawing. The latter I would say is my talent.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason why I chose Scrabble is because It holds a special place in my heart
            as it was one of the first board games I learned as a child. My father studied 
            literature in university, so he made sure I and my sisters were especially 
            learned when it came to english. Scrabble was one of the tools he introduced to 
            us to help us gain a wider vocabulary not to mention he absolutely loved playing
            it with us but when he couldn't, we settled for playing it on the family computer.
        </p>
        <p>Needless to say, my father's plan worked and even got me interested in reading literature.
            I would fully recommend this game to anyone, young or old because you never stop learning
            and it is so much fun
