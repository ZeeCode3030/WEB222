      <h2>History</h2>

      <p>
        Scrabble was originally called Criss Cross. The game created by Alfred
        M. Butts in 1931. It was based on crossword puzzles and anagrams. It was
        eventually re-branded and marketed as Scrabble by James Brunot in 1948.
        It made its first sale in Great Britain in 1954.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Scrabble continued to be one of the most popular board and tile
        games in the US and was developed in numerous foreign languages,
        Braille, and magnetic editions. Since 1973, competitions have been held
        in the US.

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Scrabble is a board and tile game in which two to four players compete
        by spelling out words on a 225-square board using lettered tiles; the
        words form a crossword-like pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the beginning and after each turn, players take seven tiles from a
        pool to start. A player can only see his own tiles on the board and the
        tiles in the pool that are kept secret from the other players. Any or
        all of a player's tiles may be exchanged for tiles in the pool in order
        to forfeit their turn. There are 100 letter tiles with a point value for
        each letter that roughly corresponds to how frequently that letter
        appears in English words.

      <p>
        Words are scored by adding the point values of their letters and
        multiplying them by one of the 61 premium squares available, which
        include double letter, triple letter, double word, and triple word.
        Scoring is possible both horizontally and vertically as the game
        progresses, with better scores recorded by forming two or more
        interlocking words at the same time. When one player has no tiles left
        or the board is deadlocked at the end of the game, the player with the
        most points wins. The values of unused letters left to players are added
        together and subtracted from their scores.
      </p>
      <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn your words especially ones with no vowels</li>
        <li>
          Use your S's wisely: 90% of the words you come up with will get gain
          you more points if you add an S afterwards
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't underestimate short words: if you are in a bind and only have
          short words, use them. They will accumulate and boost your point
        </li>
        <li>Rearrange your tiles occasionally</li>
        <li>Learn words that have hardly occurring letters like Q, X, J</li>
      </ul>
